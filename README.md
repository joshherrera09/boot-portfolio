# Personal Portfolio
Personal bootstrap responsive portfolio

## Installation

This project is a responsive portfolio website with some basic information about ourselves, a portfolio page to display our work throughout the course as well as a contact me page.

The goal was to use the skills we have learned to date in HTML, CSS and bootstrap framework, to create this page.




Some of the requirements that needed to be met and are displayed in this page are
* Functional HTML and CSS 
* Have a consistent navbar on the top of every page of the portfolio
* All of the links must work
  * Social media links
  * Nav bar links
* We must use semantic HTML to make our code easier to read, follow and edit
* Personal information including
  * Short bio
  * Image
  * Links to socials
* Properly utilize bootstrap components as well as the grid system for the layout of the pages
* Media queries

## Usage

This page will be used to display our work throughout the course.  Below is a screenshot of all 3 pages included in the project
